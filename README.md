## About the repo

This website was the project work of my Laurea University of Applied Sciences' Basics of Websites course. The course consisted of various coding exercises in web languages and of the final project, which was a self-coded website. The course mainly dealt with HTML and CSS, but you could also add code written in other web languages to the site if you wanted. I ended up adding a small piece of JavaScript and embedding external content (e.g. Google Maps).

## About the structure

The website consists of a total of five different pages, each of which deals with the theme defined by the title. The website also uses a dark theme. This is a conscious design choice that allows bright colors to appear spectacularly. In addition to this, the site has used various structures, such as divs, link lists, and embeddings, to supplement the content of the pages.

## About the implementation

The site is written in HTML5 and CSS3; in addition to this, Bootstrap and Font Awesome were used as external CSS libraries for the layout implementation. During the course, I used Notepad++ as a text editor on a Windows 10. Changes made after the course (January 2021 ->) have been made with Visual Studio Code.
